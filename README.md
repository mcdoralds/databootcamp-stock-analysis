# Green Stock Analysis

##Project Overview

###Background
The client has a list of 12 stocks their parents are interested in possibly investing in. In order to make the wisest investment decisions, they've requested that we take the 2017 and 2018 green stocks raw data and synthesize a report that will easily allow for visual compare and contrasting.

###Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze a group of 12 green stocks to help a client make investment decisions. This user-friendly and dynamic workbook using Visual Basic Application (VBA) within Excel provides each stock's annual volume and return on investment (ROI). This allows analysis of all 12 stocks with a click of a button for whichever year is specified.

##Results
###2017 vs 2018
The report includes green stock's comparison of 2017 and 2018 numbers.

As shown in data above, only  2 of the 12 stocks, ENPH and RUN produced a positive ROI in both years. Many of the stocks experienced a decline in volume between 2017 and 2018.

JKS, TERP, HASI, and SEDG showed the most stability between the two years, with less than $35k in delta in volume.
###Conclusion
The client should look more into industry-related influences and compare with other data sets in order to get a full picture of green stocks' performance in the market in relation to the rest of the stock market. He should also consider requesting analytics for 2018-2021 data. If numbers prove continuously in decline or consistently volatile, they may be better off looking at another vertical or industry. However, if numbers improve after 2018, this may indicate that green stocks are on the rise and it would be a safe investment for his parents to make.

##Summary
##Refactoring the code
A code refactoring was implemented before the project was submitted in order to maximize efficiency and speed of reporting. Improving the structure of the code proved to be a success in reducing execution time for both 2017 and 2018 data sets. This will allow the client to use the VBA Macro on other data sets for further analysis and comparison.

NOTE: Refactoring code can be dangerous if frequent backups and checkups are not made. In order to avoid overwriting working code, it's advised to save frequently and save a copy of the original code before attempting to make any big changes.
